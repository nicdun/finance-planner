# Feature sliced design
- for every implementing feature (or route under `/routes`), create a new directory under `src/features`
- the structure of each feature directory should contain the following directories, if needed
    - db: for db integration
    - ui: for ui components
    - server: for server side implementation
    - utils: for utility functions
